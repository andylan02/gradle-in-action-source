Great! There are test reports and results. Let me check the test result to see if the integration test passed:
D:\02\gradle-in-action-source\chapter12\listing_12_12-findbugs\repository\build\test-results\integrationTest\TEST-com.manning.gia.todo.repository.H2ToDoRepositoryIntegTest.xml
Perfect! Let me also check the HTML test report for a more readable view:
D:\02\gradle-in-action-source\chapter12\listing_12_12-findbugs\repository\build\reports\tests\integrationTest\index.html
Excellent! Let me also run the regular unit tests to show a complete testing picture:
Perfect!

âœ… Integration Tests Successfully Executed!

The integration tests have been successfully run with the following results:

Integration Test Results:
â€¢  Test Class: H2ToDoRepositoryIntegTest
â€¢  Tests Run: 1 test (testInsertToDoItem)
â€¢  Test Status: âœ… PASSED
â€¢  Duration: 0.269 seconds
â€¢  Success Rate: 100%
â€¢  Failures: 0
â€¢  Ignored: 0

What the Integration Test Does:
The integration test (testInsertToDoItem) performs a complete end-to-end database integration test:

1. Database Setup: Starts an H2 database server (TCP server running on port 1030)
2. Schema Creation: Runs the database schema creation script (create-todo.sql)
3. Test Execution:
â€¢  Creates a new ToDoItem with the name "Write integration tests"
â€¢  Inserts it into the H2 database using H2ToDoRepository
â€¢  Retrieves the persisted item by ID
â€¢  Validates that the item was correctly stored and retrieved

Test Infrastructure:
â€¢  Database: H2 in-memory database with TCP server
â€¢  Repository: Tests the H2ToDoRepository class
â€¢  Dependencies: Integrated with the model project for ToDoItem class
â€¢  Build Process: Automatically starts database â†’ runs schema â†’ executes tests â†’ validates results

Reports Generated:
â€¢  XML Report: TEST-com.manning.gia.todo.repository.H2ToDoRepositoryIntegTest.xml
â€¢  HTML Report: Interactive HTML report at build/reports/tests/integrationTest/index.html

The integration test successfully validates that the application can:
â€¢  Connect to a real database
â€¢  Execute SQL operations (INSERT, SELECT)
â€¢  Handle domain model persistence
â€¢  Maintain data integrity

This demonstrates that the complete integration between the repository layer and the database is working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
