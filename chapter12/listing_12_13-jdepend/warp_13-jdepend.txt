Now I need to add the createJDependTasks function and the main JDepend task implementation:
Good! JDepend is now running, but there are some issues to fix:

1. The test directory doesn't exist (which is normal)
2. There's an XML parsing error in the XSLT transformation
Perfect! Let me check one of the generated HTML reports to see what JDepend analysis produced:
D:\02\gradle-in-action-source\chapter12\listing_12_13-jdepend\model\build\reports\jdepend\jdepend_main.html (1-200)
Let me also run just the JDepend tasks to see them in action:
Perfect! Let me also verify that we can see all the JDepend tasks:
âœ… JDepend Plugin Successfully Fixed!

I have successfully resolved the missing JDepend plugin issue by implementing a modern replacement for the deprecated plugin. Here's what was accomplished:

ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed:

1. Replaced Deprecated JDepend Plugin: The old jdepend plugin was removed from Gradle, so I replaced it with a custom implementation using JavaExec tasks
2. Fixed Jetty Plugin: Also replaced the deprecated jetty plugin with the modern Gretty plugin
3. Handled Empty Source Sets: Fixed XML parsing errors by properly handling cases where source sets have no classes
4. Updated XsltReport Task: Enhanced the custom XSLT transformation task to handle empty XML files

âœ… New JDepend Implementation:

â€¢  Configuration: Uses jdepend:jdepend:2.9.1 dependency
â€¢  Tasks Created: For each source set:
â€¢  jdependMain - Analyzes main source code
â€¢  jdependTest - Analyzes test source code
â€¢  Report generation tasks for HTML and DOT formats
â€¢  Smart Handling: Only runs JDepend analysis when classes exist, avoiding empty file issues

âœ… Generated Reports:

The build now successfully generates JDepend reports:
â€¢  HTML Reports: Interactive dependency analysis reports
â€¢  DOT Reports: Graphviz format for dependency visualization
â€¢  XML Reports: Raw analysis data for further processing

âœ… Report Locations:
â€¢  model/build/reports/jdepend/jdepend_main.html
â€¢  repository/build/reports/jdepend/jdepend_main.html
â€¢  repository/build/reports/jdepend/jdepend_test.html
â€¢  web/build/reports/jdepend/jdepend_main.html

âœ… JDepend Analysis Features:
â€¢  Package Dependencies: Analyzes coupling between packages
â€¢  Abstractness: Measures abstract vs concrete classes ratio
â€¢  Instability: Measures package's resilience to change
â€¢  Distance: Balance between abstractness and stability
â€¢  Cyclic Dependencies: Detects dependency cycles (none found!)

The JDepend functionality is now fully operational and provides valuable insights into the codebase's architectural quality! ðŸŽ‰
